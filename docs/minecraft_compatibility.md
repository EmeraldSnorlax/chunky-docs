# Minecraft Compatibility

Chunky can render most blocks in Minecraft up to version 1.12.2.
The oldest Minecraft version supported
is Minecraft 1.2.1, in which the Anvil world format was introduced.  Older
versions of Minecraft use a different format that is not supported.
In Minecraft 1.13, the world format changed again and Chunky does not yet support it.

be rendered either. Here is a list of all things that Chunky does not render:
